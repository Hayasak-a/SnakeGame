Implementation of Final Project

Complete:
Color added to game
Difficulty levels
Color the menu with each item in the menu with different color (other than black -:p)
Eat itself - reduce the overall length 
// Since eating food to increase size isn't implemented, I instead set the snake's initial size to 5 so this method works. It only works if the head and tail would be in the same place AFTER movement - the snake doesn't eat itself if the head moves to a spot at the same time the tail moves away
Create the Multi-player functionality where we would be able to control the second snake with 'AWSD' letters.
//Multi-player functionality 


Partial Incompletions:
Difficulty levels don't affect speed of game
Multiplayer snakes don't interact

Incomplete, code exists but crashes:
Introduce new enemy snakes & update game over scenario

Incomplete:
Display list of saved games and Load one
Load games from files
Newly spawned enemy snakes should bounce back

// There's a menu option for this. It doesn't work.
