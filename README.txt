Implementation of Project Milestone 2
Since I failed to complete Milestone 1, many objectives from that are incomplete
However, all features

The only feature with an error is reversing the snake upon hitting an obstacle. The snake will correctly reverse, but the obstacle will 'eat' the head of the snake, shrinking it

Hitting "," will remove the tail from the snake. This is used to implement a game over scenario despite not having any (intended) way to shrink the snake
